    Day 6 of Java - OOP Advanced I
    Lesson tackled: Inheritance, Composition, Interface, Abstract, and Dependency Injection.

    Task: 
    1. You're designing a Payment System:
    2. There are different payment methods: Cash, GCash, CreditCard.
    3. All payment methods can process payment (interface rule).
    4. Some methods share common behavior, like validating amount (abstract class).
    5. PaymentProcessor uses dependency injection to receive any payment method.
    Bonus: Add a User class that has a payment method (composition).
